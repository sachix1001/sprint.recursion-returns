# Recursion Returns
### This was created during my time as a [Code Chrysalis](https://codechrysalis.io) Student

This looks familiar! We will practice recursion again, with some familiar and some new problems.

## Objectives

Continue doing the following:

* Be able to use Node and yarn to run tests
* Ensure there are at least four tests for each function
* Be able to commit code after each milestone

This assignment focuses on using recursion in a real-life application scenario (`getElementsByClassName`) and in a more hypothetical/algorithmic scenario.

* Identify base and recursive cases to solve complex repetitive tasks

## Set Up

Fork and clone this repository following the Code Chrysalis git flow instructions.

Install dependencies: `yarn install`

Command to run tests: `yarn test`

## Basic Requirements

1. The tests for `getElementsByClassName.js` is quite complex so we have kept it for you. Please read through the test specs to get a sense of how those particular tests are created. Can you explain it out-loud?
1. Complete `src/getElementByClassName.js`
    1. The Document object in JavaScript is amazing. It does a lot of beautiful things for you, like getting all the elements on a page by their classname. But we don't like easy! So we'll make you write your own.
1. Complete `src/robotPaths.js`
    1. A robot located at the top left corner of an N x N grid is trying to reach the bottom right corner. The robot can move horizontally and vertically, but it cannot move diagonally and cannot visit the same square twice. How many possible unique paths are there to the bottom right corner?

## Medium Requirements

1. Write at least four tests for `src/stringifyJSON.js`
1. Complete `src/stringifyJSON.js`

## Advanced Requirements

1. Complete `src/parseJSON.js`: You cannot use `JSON.parse`---you'll need to write your own.
